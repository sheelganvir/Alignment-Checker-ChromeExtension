# Alignment-Checker-ChromeExtension

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code for a Chrome extension designed to help users check and compare the alignment of various elements on their screen. Whether you're a web developer ensuring pixel-perfect designs or a designer checking the precision of layouts, this tool offers essential features for verifying alignment.

## Features

1. **Alignment Check**:
   - Allows users to check the alignment of texts, icons, and other display elements.
   - Users can compare the alignment of objects with others in the same vertical line to ensure consistent placement.

2. **Measurement Scale**:
   - Provides a measurement scale feature that shows the relative alignment of one object compared to another.
   - The scale is equal in size to the display, ensuring full-screen coverage for comprehensive checks.
   - The height and width of the scale are adjustable to fit various screen sizes and layouts.

3. **Transparent Scale**:
   - The scale is designed to be transparent, showing only borders and markings to avoid obstructing the view of the objects being aligned.
   - This feature ensures that users can check alignments without distraction.

4. **Interactive Popup**:
   - Users can activate the extension by clicking the extension button, which triggers a popup scale on the display screen.
   - This interactive popup allows users to easily check the alignment of objects on the screen.
